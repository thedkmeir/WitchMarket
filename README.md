🧙‍♀️ Witch Market

The world’s worst-kept witch secret—your source for potions, spellbooks, broom upgrades, and questionable “locally-sourced” frog hats.

✨ What is this?

Welcome to Witch Market—a (joke) “dark web” shopping portal exclusively for witches who are tired of the same old cauldron sales at their local cursed mall. This is where you’ll find everything from exclusive potions to unique accessories, and some extremely sketchy spell enhancements you definitely should not use on your neighbors.

Built in React. Filter and shop to your witchy heart’s content. Score discounts by beating a cheeky AI at Tic-Tac-Toe. (You won’t.)

🪄 Features

	•	🧹 Filter products by category, price, in-stock status, or with an ancient search spell (actually just a search bar).
	•	🛒 Add & remove items from a floating cart.
	•	🧾 Checkout with a slick animated modal and download a printable receipt (for your accountant familiar).
	•	🎲 Challenge the AI to Tic-Tac-Toe for a 15% discount. (It cheats. You’ll lose. Try anyway.)
	•	🦴 Cart persists using localStorage, so your hexes are never lost on reload.
	•	💅 Responsive design and absolutely on-theme “witchy” fonts.
	•	🥚 Easter eggs and hidden secrets. Hunt them down. (Start by poking the corners.)

🧙‍♂️ Getting Started
npm install
npm start

That’s it. No docker, no fancy backend, no complicated magic circles.

Plus a sprinkling of stars, cauldrons, cats, and sarcasm.

🦇 Mood

Sarcastic. A bit stupid. Not dumb.
Think “witch memes, but make it ✨aesthetic✨.”

⸻

📸 Screenshots

Not included. True witches don’t need screenshots, they see with their third eye.

👻 Disclaimer

This is a joke project. No real curses were cast, no frogs were harmed.
If you’re here looking for actual potion recipes, seek help.

🌠 Have fun!

Try to find all the secrets. Or don’t.
