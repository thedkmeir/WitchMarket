// should do

TODO this is a big one... try to make that big crazy animation...: when clicking a product it will fly over to the cart icon and fade.

TODO the modalmanger needs a re-whole... i feel like the whole upper bar and backdrop shold be on the modal and not on the modal manager side... also change the dissmisable var to only work with clicking the backdrop...

TODO add a new yes no modal...

TODO in the cleanse cauldron button use the yes no modal to confirm...

TODO write a good md file for this project...

// thinking about it

TODO a Welcome screen where you get a nice clean welcoming page... and you enter your name to get in...

TODO when summoning the receipt modal i want there to be like fireworks or a big almost full screen thing behind the modal (add a toggler to the modal to activate this or not...)

TODO if the human actually wins the tictactoe game (by cheating probably...) show a message saying you lied about the 15% off... also hint that he cheated because he probably did...

TODO clean up all comments 

// might drop
