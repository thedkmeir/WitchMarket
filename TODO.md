// should do

TODO this is a big one... try to make that big crazy animation...: when clicking a product it will fly over to the cart icon and fade.

TODO the modalmanger needs a re-whole... i feel like the whole upper bar and backdrop shold be on the modal and not on the modal manager side... also change the dissmisable var to only work with clicking the backdrop...

TODO write a good md file for this project...

// thinking about it

TODO a Welcome screen where you get a nice clean welcoming page... and you enter your name to get in...

TODO when summoning the receipt modal i want there to be like fireworks or a big almost full screen thing behind the modal (add a toggler to the modal to activate this or not...)

TODO clean up all comments 

TODO make a small easy to find easter egg that says the 15% is a lie! make this popup by clicking an invisible button somewhere...

// might drop
